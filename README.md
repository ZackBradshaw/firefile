### Quick Overview:
Effortlessly convert Python to Mojo with our tool. It scans Python files, refactors them to Mojo syntax, and optimizes the code for Mojoâ€”all automatically. This tool is designed to simplify the transition for developers moving to Mojo.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Conversion:** Automates the process of converting Python code to Mojo, streamlining the transition.
- **Error Reduction:** Implements checks to minimize conversion errors, thereby saving developers' time.
- **Community Support:** Access to our Discord for collaboration, support, and sharing insights.
- **CLI Interaction:** Enhanced command-line interaction for specifying directories and initiating the conversion process directly from the terminal.

### Getting Started:
#### Setup:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### Usage:
1. Navigate to the root directory of your Python project.
2. Run the conversion script with `python main.py` and follow the CLI prompts.
3. Review the converted files, now with a `.mojo` extension, in the same directory.

#### To-Do List for Full Functionality:
- [ ] Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
- [ ] Add support for batch processing of multiple files.
- [ ] Enhance error handling for unsupported Python features.
- [ ] Integrate with OpenAI's API to suggest improvements on the converted Mojo code directly within the conversion process.
